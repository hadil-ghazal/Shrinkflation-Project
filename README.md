# Shrinkflation, Measured: What Smaller Packages Actually Did to Prices

This project uses data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to explore **shrinkflation** — the practice of reducing product sizes while keeping prices the same.  

By combining two research datasets:  
- **R-CPI-SC Index** → shows what inflation would look like if package sizes never changed  
- **Frequency of Size Changes** → counts how often products in the CPI sample were downsized or upsized  

We can see both **how much prices changed** and **how often shrinkflation events occurred**.

## Key Findings
- **Shrinkflation is frequent:** Downsizing spiked in 2021–2022, peaking at ~74 events in a 12-month span, while upsizing stayed far lower.  
- **Groceries surged:** *Food at home* prices rose ~+28.7% above Dec 2019, even after adjusting for shrinkflation.  
- **Uneven impact:** Some categories (e.g., eggs, beef, juices) saw much larger cumulative increases than the overall basket.  
- **Double effect:** The hardest-hit categories are where both **prices rose fastest** and **downsizing was most common**, amplifying the consumer experience.
